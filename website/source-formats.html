<h2>Source Formats</h2>

Various Cantaloupe processors support several other formats than those listed here; what follows are mainly just notes.</p>

<h3 id="JPEG">JPEG</h3>

<p>It should be possible to use TurboJPEG (high-level API over <a href="http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org">libjpeg-turbo</a> with Java2dProcessor to hardware-accelerate JPEG coding. To do so, include the <a href="https://github.com/geosolutions-it/imageio-ext/wiki/TurboJPEG-plugin">TurboJPEG plugin JAR</a> in your classpath, and compile libjpeg-turbo with Java support (using the <code>--with-java</code>
configuration option). (The author has not tried this.)</p>

<h3 id="JPEG2000">JPEG2000</h3>

<p>JPEG2000 uses advanced compression techniques to enable fast reduced-scale and region-of-interest decoding. In theory, and with a performant decoder, JPEG2000 is well-suited for extremely large source images. Unfortunately, there are few performant decoders available for this format.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#KakaduProcessor">KakaduProcessor</a> is by far the most efficient processor for this format. With a fast multi-core CPU that supports Kakadu's hardware acceleration features, it can basically cut through hundreds-of-megapixel source images like they are nothing.</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#GraphicsMagickProcessor">GraphicsMagick</a> can read/write JPEG2000 using JasPer, and <a href="processors.html#ImageMagickProcessor">ImageMagick</a> using OpenJPEG. Both of these are extremely slow.</p>

<p>See the <a href="processors.html#JaiProcessor">JaiProcessor</a> section for notes on the mediaLib accelerator.</p>

<h3 id="TIFF">TIFF</h3>

<p><a href="processors.html#GraphicsMagickProcessor">GraphicsMagickProcessor</a> and <a href="processors.html#ImageMagickProcessor">ImageMagickProcessor</a> can both handle TIFF if the necessary delegate or plugin is installed. (See the <a href="getting-started.html#Running">Cantaloupe landing page</a>.)</p>

<h4>Pyramidal TIFF</h4>

<p>Pyramidal TIFF is a special type of TIFF that improves TIFF's suitability for deep zooming applications. In addition to the main image, a pyramidal TIFF file contains a sequence of progressively half-sized sub-images: for example, a 10000x10000 pixel main image would include derivatives of 5000x5000 pixels, 2500x2500 pixels, 1250x1250 pixels, and so on, all embedded inside the same file. These smaller images are more efficient to read at small scales (shallow zoom levels).</p>

<p><a href="processors.html#Java2dProcessor">Java2dProcessor</a> and <a href="processors.html#JaiProcessor">JaiProcessor</a> both support pyramidal TIFF, which is to say that they actually do read the embedded sub-images and choose the smallest one that can fulfill the request.</p>

<p>All other processors that support TIFF will read pyramidal TIFFs as ordinary TIFFs, ignoring the sub-images.</p>

<h2>Developer's Guide</h2>

<p>Cantaloupe is a standard Maven project that should open right up in any Java IDE. Simply use the same configuration file and VM options (e.g. <code>-Dcantaloupe.config=...</code>) as you would when running from a JAR.</p>

<h3 id="Resolvers">Custom Resolvers</h3>

<p>A resolver is a class that implements the <code>e.i.l.c.resolver.FileResolver</code>
and/or <code>e.i.l.c.resolver.StreamResolver</code> interfaces. Then, to use it, set <code>resolver</code> in your configuration file to its name.</p>

<p>See one of the existing resolvers for examples.</p>

<h3 id="Processors">Custom Image Processors</h3>

<p>A processor is a class that implements the <code>e.i.l.c.processor.FileProcessor</code>
and/or <code>e.i.l.c.processor.StreamProcessor</code> interfaces. See the interface documentation for details and the existing implementations for examples.</p>

<p>Another option might be to add an ImageIO format plugin instead of a custom processor; then it would work with Java2dProcessor or JaiProcessor.</p>

<h3 id="Caches">Custom Caches</h3>

<p>A cache is a class that implements the <code>e.i.l.c.cache.Cache</code> interface. See the interface documentation for details and the existing implementations for
examples.</p>

<h3 id="Contributing">Contributing</h3>

<p>Ideas, suggestions, feature requests, bug reports, and other kinds of feedback are welcome; <a href="mailto:alexd@illinois.edu">contact the author</a>, or submit an issue or pull request.</p>

<p>This project uses the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/">Gitflow</a> branching model. All changes should take place in feature branches ("feature/xxxx") that branch off from the main branch, "develop." They can then be cleanly integrated, by the release manager, into a particular release.</p>

<p>The general process for contributing code changes is:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/medusa-project/cantaloupe/fork">Create a fork</a></li>
  <li>Create a feature branch (<code>git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature</code>)</li>
  <li>Commit your changes (<code>`git commit -am 'Add some feature'</code>)</li>
  <li>Push to the branch (<code>git push origin feature/my-new-feature</code>)</li>
  <li>Create a new Pull Request</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Administrative">Administrative</h3>

<p>(This section is for release managers only.)</p>

<h4 id="Website">Website</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> website compiler transforms the HTML pages in the <span class="filename">website</span> folder into a working static website. The <span class="filename">build/deploy_website.rb</span> script takes care of building the website, adding the current Javadoc to it, committing it, and deploying it to GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>To merely preview the website without releasing it, <code>cd</code> into the <span class="filename">website</span> folder and run <code>jekyll serve</code>, then go to <a href="http://localhost:4000/">http://localhost:4000/</a> in a web browser.</p>

<h4 id="Versioning">Versioning</h4>

<p>Cantaloupe roughly uses semantic versioning. Major releases (n) break backwards compatibility in a major way. Minor releases (n.n) either do not break it, or only in a minor/trivial way. Patch releases (n.n.n) are for bugfixes only.</p>

<p>Note that the above statement covers public API (the HTTP endpoints) only. Internals may change significantly from release to release (though this is not really likely.)</p>

<p>Because Cantaloupe is generally intended to provide stable APIs, major version increments should be expected to be rare.</p>

<h4 id="Releasing">Releasing</h4>

<p>Currently, the release process is mostly manual. The steps involved are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Finalize the code to be released, addressing any relevant milestone issues, TODOs, etc.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the tests are current, comprehensive, and passing</li>
  <li>Finalize the documentation, including the website, upgrade guide, and change log</li>
  <li>Merge into "release/x.x"</li>
  <li>Update the version in <span class="filename">pom.xml</span> and commit this change</li>
  <li>Merge into "master"</li>
  <li>Create the release .zip archive with <code>mvn package</code></li>
  <li>Check that the .zip archive is as expected</li>
  <li>Tag the release: <code>git tag -a {version} -m 'Tag {version}'</code></li>
  <li>Push the code: <code>git push origin master; git push origin release/x.x; git push --tags</code></li>
  <li>Add the .zip archive and change log info to the release tag on GitHub</li>
  <li>Deploy the updated website: <code>build/deploy_website.rb</code></li>
</ol>

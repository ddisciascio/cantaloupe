<h2>Access Control</h2>

<h3 id="Authentication">Authentication</h3>

<p>Cantaloupe has built-in support for HTTP Basic authentication. To enable it, set the following keys in the configuration file:</p>

<pre>http.auth.basic = true
http.auth.basic.username = myusername
http.auth.basic.secret = mypassword</pre>

<p>When enabled, the entire website will be restricted.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">HTTP Basic transmits passwords in clear text, so it should only be used on a trusted local network, or in conjunction with SSL/TLS.</div>

<p>A reverse proxy server can be used to support other means of authentication.</p>

<h3 id="Authorization">Authorization</h3>

<p>Currently, Cantaloupe is not authorization-aware.</p>
